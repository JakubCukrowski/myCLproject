Psychology website, using react.js. </br>
You can create an account and schedule a visit, check your visits and manage them. </br>
Project uses firestore and firebase </br>
I've added a netlify function, which in help of cron-job.org deletes order visits. </br>
Scheduling visits is refreshed life, that means 2 users shouldn't be able to schedule same visit. </br>
Website is responsive. </br>
